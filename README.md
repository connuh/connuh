### Projects 🖥️
> Here you can find a list of projects I have contributed to in some way shape or form!
- [pays.host](https://pays.host) — pays.host is a custom ShareX image uploader with 800+ domains.
	- pays.host was an amazing thing for my Development career, although I didn't do much I learnt a hell of a lot and I highly reccomend them.
- [Courvix](https://courvix.com/bpf.php) — Courvix is a network of <strong>FREE</strong> Internet services. Currently they offer webmail and a VPN.
	- Designing the BPF page for Courvix.com was a really nice excercise to help further my Web Design skills. 
- [Attack Detection](https://github.com/connuh/attack-detection) — Attack Detection is a full stack Web Application that monitors incoming packets for DDoS attacks.
	- This project helped me tremendously as I made the move from SSR to CSR and implementing live data from a client! There were many obstaces that I had to programmatically overcome such as writing my own buffer system for sending large amounts of data over TCP using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
